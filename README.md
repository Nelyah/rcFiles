# My environment files :

These files are mainly meant to be used by me, and as such you might want to modify them after downloading them.

The setup script is meant to be as clear and readible as possible, however installing everything may replace files that you didn't expect to (installing bashrc will replace any already existing bashrc!)
I therefore highly suggest you to at least take a look at the script and look at what it does before running it.

## To use the repo:
Some of my config files contain personnal informations (ssh logins, etc.) that I decided to remove from public access.
My VIM install and config files are still freely available for those who would like to take a look at them.
Run the script `./setup.sh` and it will ask for options on what it should install.
